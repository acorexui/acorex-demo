      "p1": "Before ACoreX, we used many libraries in our organization, and each had its strengths and weaknesses. For example, at that time and even now, in some cases, RTL support was not well implemented, and we always had problems with localization and discussions such as dates and calendars. The next point was performance, as some large libraries created problems. Since integration, performance, and project maintenance were very important to us, we started producing ACoreX. Its first version was very light and small, to the point that we were able to produce a form builder with it, and we gradually developed and made it larger."
